.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBpgbouncer\fP is a PostgreSQL connection pooler. Any target application
can be connected to \fBpgbouncer\fP as if it were a PostgreSQL server,
and \fBpgbouncer\fP will create a connection to the actual server, or it
will reuse one of its existing connections.
.sp
The aim of \fBpgbouncer\fP is to lower the performance impact of opening
new connections to PostgreSQL.
.sp
In order not to compromise transaction semantics for connection
pooling, \fBpgbouncer\fP supports several types of pooling when
rotating connections:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Session pooling
Most polite method. When client connects, a server connection will
be assigned to it for the whole duration the client stays connected. When
the client disconnects, the server connection will be put back into the pool.
This is the default method.
.TP
.B Transaction pooling
A server connection is assigned to client only during a transaction.
When PgBouncer notices that transaction is over, the server connection
will be put back into the pool.
.TP
.B Statement pooling
Most aggressive method. The server connection will be put back into
pool immediately after a query completes. Multi\-statement
transactions are disallowed in this mode as they would break.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The administration interface of \fBpgbouncer\fP consists of some new
\fBSHOW\fP commands available when connected to a special \(aqvirtual\(aq
database \fBpgbouncer\fP.
.SH QUICK-START
.sp
Basic setup and usage as following.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Create a pgbouncer.ini file.  Details in \fBpgbouncer(5)\fP.  Simple example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[databases]
template1 = host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 dbname=template1

[pgbouncer]
listen_port = 6543
listen_addr = 127.0.0.1
auth_type = md5
auth_file = users.txt
logfile = pgbouncer.log
pidfile = pgbouncer.pid
admin_users = someuser
.ft P
.fi
.IP 2. 3
Create \fBusers.txt\fP file that contains users allowed in:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
"someuser" "same_password_as_in_server"
.ft P
.fi
.IP 3. 3
Launch \fBpgbouncer\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pgbouncer \-d pgbouncer.ini
.ft P
.fi
.IP 4. 3
Have your application (or the \fBpsql\fP client) connect to
\fBpgbouncer\fP instead of directly to PostgreSQL server:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ psql \-p 6543 \-U someuser template1
.ft P
.fi
.IP 5. 3
Manage \fBpgbouncer\fP by connecting to the special administration
database \fBpgbouncer\fP and issuing \fBshow help;\fP to begin:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ psql \-p 6543 \-U someuser pgbouncer
pgbouncer=# show help;
NOTICE:  Console usage
DETAIL:

.ft P
.fi
.IP 6. 3
If you made changes to the pgbouncer.ini file, you can reload it with:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
pgbouncer=# RELOAD;
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.SH COMMAND LINE SWITCHES
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-d
Run in background. Without it the process will run in foreground.
Note: Does not work on Windows, \fBpgbouncer\fP need to run as service there.
.TP
.B \-R
Do an online restart. That means connecting to the running process,
loading the open sockets from it, and then using them.  If there
is no active process, boot normally.
Note: Works only if OS supports Unix sockets and the \fIunix_socket_dir\fP
is not disabled in config.  Does not work on Windows machines.
Does not work with TLS connections, they are dropped.
.TP
.BI \-u \ user
Switch to the given user on startup.
.TP
.B \-v
Increase verbosity.  Can be used multiple times.
.TP
.B \-q
Be quiet \- do not log to stdout.  Note this does not affect
logging verbosity, only that stdout is not to be used.
For use in init.d scripts.
.TP
.B \-V
Show version.
.TP
.B \-h
Show short help.
.TP
.B \-\-regservice
Win32: Register pgbouncer to run as Windows service.  The \fBservice_name\fP
config parameter value is used as name to register under.
.TP
.B \-\-unregservice
Win32: Unregister Windows service.
.UNINDENT
.SH ADMIN CONSOLE
.sp
The console is available by connecting as normal to the
database \fBpgbouncer\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ psql \-p 6543 pgbouncer
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Only users listed in configuration parameters \fBadmin_users\fP or \fBstats_users\fP
are allowed to login to the console.  (Except when \fIauth_mode=any\fP, then
any user is allowed in as a stats_user.)
.sp
Additionally, the username \fBpgbouncer\fP is allowed to log in without password,
if the login comes via Unix socket and the client has same Unix user uid
as the running process.
